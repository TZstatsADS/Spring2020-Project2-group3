# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

Also, all files realted to data cleansing are saved here, so that the final code that are used in shiny app are in clear organization.

### DistData Folder
This folder contains all the distances computed from the historical housing sale data.
The noise distance matrix can be download from the url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eYJ7UcVRe9w_rnaLpl3rAi74ozV9uBUA/view?ts=5e4d68ea
