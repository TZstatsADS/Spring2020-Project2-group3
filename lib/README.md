# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

Also, all files realted to data cleansing are saved here, so that the final code that are used in shiny app are in clear organization.
